        <li>In the bottom of the pan, place 8 of the double chocolate cookies and then break a 9th cookies and fill in the gaps. Spread 1/4 of the mocha cream evenly on the cookies. Press more cookies lighty into the filling and add another 1/4 layor of cream on top to create more layers. Continue doing the same process until all the ingredients run out (5 cookie layers and 4 cream layers) or to your desired layers. Wrap and chill the cake for 12 to 24 hours</li>
        <li>Once the cake had chilled and ready to serve, take a thin knife and gently run it through the edge of the cake and the inside springform pan ring. Release the spring and slide the cake off gently, slice, and serve. </li>
